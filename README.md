# ü§ñ AI Email Agent with Gemma 3n E4B

This repository contains a Google Colab notebook that creates an automated email agent. The agent is designed to intelligently generate and send personalized emails for professional outreach, such as job applications or networking.

The core of the agent's functionality is a pipeline that:

1. # **Scrapes company information** from websites to find key details and potential email addresses.

2. **Generates a personalized email** using the powerful **Gemma 3n E4B** large language model from Google via the Hugging Face library.

3. **Sends the email** using the Gmail API.

## ‚ú® Features

* ‚úÖ **Automated Company Scraping:** Efficiently extracts company descriptions and email addresses from target websites.

* ‚úÖ **AI-Powered Personalization:** Leverages Gemma 3n E4B to craft unique, context-aware emails that highlight relevant skills and projects.

* ‚úÖ **Gmail API Integration:** Securely sends emails directly from your Gmail account.

* ‚úÖ **Ethical Scraping:** Includes built-in rate limiting and a respectful approach to web scraping.

* ‚úÖ **Colab-Ready:** Designed to run seamlessly in a Google Colab environment, with support for GPU acceleration.
